## 🧪 Overview

This repository contains practical implementations from the **Compiler Construction Lab (T7478)** course.  
The lab focuses on understanding and applying the concepts of **LEX** and **YACC** to build simple compilers, parsers, and interpreters.

Through these experiments, students gain hands-on experience with lexical analysis, syntax analysis, expression evaluation, and intermediate code generation.

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes

After successful completion of this lab, students will be able to:

- Understand the roles of **Lexical Analyzers** and **Syntax Analyzers** in compilation.  
- Use **LEX** to generate tokens and **YACC** to design parsers.  
- Implement **mini-compilers** for expression evaluation and code generation.  
- Design and simulate parsers for control structures such as the `FOR` loop.  
- Develop error-handling mechanisms using parsing techniques.
