## 🧪 Overview

This repository contains practical implementations from the **Compiler Construction Lab (T7478)** course.  
The lab focuses on understanding and applying the concepts of **LEX** and **YACC** to build simple compilers, parsers, and interpreters.

Through these experiments, students gain hands-on experience with lexical analysis, syntax analysis, expression evaluation, and intermediate code generation.
