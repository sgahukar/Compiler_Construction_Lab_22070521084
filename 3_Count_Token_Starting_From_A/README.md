## ðŸŽ¯ Aim:

To write a **LEX program** that reads a given text and counts the number of **words that start with the letter 'A'** or 'a'.

---

## ðŸ“š Theory:

In compiler design, lexical analysis is the phase where the source code is divided into tokens using pattern recognition. **LEX** (Lexical Analyzer Generator) helps automate this phase by generating C code that recognizes patterns using **regular expressions**.

### ðŸ”¹ Key Concepts:

- **Words**: A word is a sequence of characters grouped together, usually separated by whitespace or punctuation.
- **Pattern Matching**: In this practical, we use LEX to match words that **start with 'A' or 'a'**.
- **Regular Expressions**: The pattern `[aA][a-zA-Z]*` matches any word that starts with 'A' or 'a' followed by any alphabet characters.

### ðŸ”¹ Sample Rule in LEX:
```lex
[aA][a-zA-Z]*    { count++; }
```

This rule increments the count whenever a word starting with 'A' or 'a' is detected.

## âœ… Conclusion:

- Successfully implemented a LEX program to count all words beginning with the letter **'A'** or **'a'**.
- Understood how regular expressions are used for pattern recognition in lexical analysis.
- Practiced developing simple lexical analyzers for token-based word analysis.
